# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
## HoneyComb 
- I signed up for [HoneyComb](https://ui.honeycomb.io/)

- I created an environment and stored my api key in a scratchpad

- I pasted it to the terminal and set it as an environment variable using the `export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="<insert your api key here>"` command. And i saved it using `gp env export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="<insert API key here>"`  
- I set my honeycomb service name and saved to the environment. 
- I added the OTEL service name, endpoint and headers to my docker-compose.yml file  
> OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"  
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"  
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"

- I changed directory to the **backend-flask** directory
- I went to honeycombs python instruction section, copied the installation commands there and added them to my requirements.txt file 
>   opentelemetry-api
    opentelemetry-sdk 
    opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
    opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests  

and ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`   

- I copied the import statements from initialize section and pasted it in my **app.py** file.  

>   from opentelemetry import trace  
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor


- I copied the trace provider section to my app.py file 

>   # Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
    provider = TracerProvider()  
    processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())  
    provider.add_span_processor(processor)  
    trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)  
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)  

- I copied and pasted the part to initialise automatic instrumentations with flask, removing the already existing `app = Flask(__name__)` line.  
>   FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)  
    RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()  

- I changed directory to my **frontend-react-js** directory, and i ran `npm i`.   
-  I went back to my production directory, right clicked on my docker-compose file, and did a docker-compose up. 


- I went to honeycomb and checked for data, and there was data in the dataset.  
-  
- I set my ports on the gitpod.yml file, so i don't have to keep unlocking them everytime.  
- I ran a trace for specific api calls to see more details  

### Hardcoding a SPAN 
- I checked the [honeycomb docs](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python/) for the required command to aquire a tracer for my **home activities**  
- I copied the command 
`from opentelemetry import trace` 
`tracer = trace.get_tracer("home.activities")` 
`with tracer.start_as_current_span("home-activities-mock-data"):`  
to my **home_activities.py** file. 
- I went to my frontend directory, did my `npm i`
- I docker comosed up, went to the web pages to check them out, then i went to honeycomb to see if the extra span would show up for 'Home activities'  


### Adding Attributes to the span 
- I went back to the honeycombs python docs, copied the necesasary command for adding attributes, and i added it to my **home_activities.py** file.
