# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Create An Admin User
- I created an IAM user 
Signed into the `AWS Management Console` and opened the [IAM console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/?region=us-east-1#)  
![iam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/219350512-d689198f-0848-4087-a487-dafa89ba89c5.png)  

- I created a new IAM user and `enable console access` for the user

- I created a new `Admin group` and granted the group `Administrator Access`

- I selected the check mark next to the `Aministrator group`, and clicked Next: Review and Create   
- I chose `create user`  
- Downloaded the CSV with the credentials  
- Returned to user list and clicked on the user name  
- Clicked on `Security Credentials` and `Create access key`

- I chose `AWS CLI Access` and clicked on create Access key  
- Downloaded the CSV with the credentials   
-Setup Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for my new user, this is best practice.  
- Signed out of root user and signed in as the new IAM user

## Install and verify the AWS CLI 
- I followed the instructions on the [AWS Command Line Interface Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)  
- Copy and paste the command needed to install the CLI on your respective device. *I am using Linux so i followed the instructions for Linux systems.* 
- Run the following commands, one at a time to avoid any problems. *Copying it all at once might work too, but sometimes it's better to do it line by line to get the expected results.*  
`curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"`  
`unzip awscliv2.zip`   
`sudo ./aws/install`   

### Setting up ENV Variable 
- I could've used **aws configure** to set up the CLI, but i set up my environment variable with gitpod instead. 
- I created a file and typed these commands into the file  
`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your access id"`   
`export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your access key>`   
`export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>`   

- Copied and pasted the commands into my gitpod terminal one at a time.   
- Confirmed if i set it right by typing `env | grep AWS_` *this should me the copied details.*   
- Typed `aws sts get-caller-identity` and it outputed my User Id, Acoount and Arn.   
- Told gitpod to remember these credentials next time i open your workspace. by typing the following commands.  
`gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""`   
`gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""`   
`gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1`   

- Added a script to my gitpod.yml file to make sure that everytime i start up my workspace it loads these settings and i don't have to do it all over again.  
![updated YAML file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/219480714-6b68e57d-8188-4f2b-81ea-2dc43890f833.png)   
- Commited the changes 
- Double checked by going to my repo and confirming the changes were applied.  
- exited gitpod and re-entered gitpod to test if the script works and everything gets setup immediately the workspace is loaded

## Enabling Billing 
- Turn on Billing Alerts to recieve alerts. 
- I went to my AWS management console  
- Searched for billing 
![AWS biling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/219485504-7351eba7-e179-4649-ac64-53d61f8db964.png)


- I encountered a permissions error because i was signed in as my IAM user so i logged out and signed in as root user  
- I went to the billing page, and under `Billing Preferences` i choose `Receive Billing Alerts`  
- i also chose to receive free tier usage alert under the **Cost Management Preferences**  
- I clicked on `Save Preferences`

## Creating a billing alarm
**Create SNS Topic**  

- We need to create an SNS topic before we can create an alarm. The SNS topic is what will send us an alert when we get overbilled.  

- [create aws sns topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)   

- I used the AWS CLI Command reference document as a guide 
![create topic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/219489445-6fded97a-3fb0-4fc4-b6e4-b1cff409927e.png)   

- Created an SNS Topic by typing the following command  
`aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm`  
*it outputed the ARN assigned to the created topic*
