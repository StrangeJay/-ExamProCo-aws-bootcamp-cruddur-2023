# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication 


- I went to my AWS management console, searched for **Amazon Cognito** and clicked into it.  ![create user pool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/224273651-e778ad11-d0ed-40a1-a5e7-7d2bc5b2052e.png)  

- I saw 2 options for provider types, ""Cognito User Pool"" and ""Federated Identity Providers**

> **Note** "Cognito user pool" is for when you're making a web application and you want to add login and signup, and manage it externally. While federated identity providers, is when you want to be able to login using a social identity from another provider. With user pool you can add different methods of identity providers, but federated is a little different. 

- I checked the option to log in with **user name** and **email.**  
- I set password polict to default

- I left the option to use MFA unchecked, to save and prevent spend.

- I enabled self account recovery to allow users revover their accounts by themselves without having to email me to reset it for them.  

- I chose only email as the delivery method for recovery message, because it cost money to use SMS and i don't want to incure spend.
