# Week 1 â€” App Containerization 

## Contenarize Backend 

### Add a Dockerfile
- I created a Dockerfile file in the **Bckend-flask** directory. 
- I copied and pasted the command gotten from the [Omen king Crudder Repo](https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-1/journal/week1.md) and pasted it into my Dockerfile.
