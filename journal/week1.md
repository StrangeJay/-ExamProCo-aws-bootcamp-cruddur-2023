# Week 1 â€” App Containerization 

## Contenarize Backend 

### Run Flask locally
- I changed directory to the **backend-flask** directory
- I ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary requirements
- I ran the code `python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567` 
- I went to the address on `exposed ports` but kept getting 404 error from the server 
- ![exposed ports](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105195327/221190009-690bfd01-9f57-44bd-a774-949fcc176f4a.png)

- I unlocked the 4567 port and made it public, and tried again, i got the same error. 

- I was receiving a 404 error in the terminal

*This means the server is running and it's accepting requests, but nothing is showing up*.   

- I appended the endpoint `/api/activities/home` to the url and this time i got a different error

- I configured the frontend and backend environment variable by running the following command 
`export FRONTEND_URL="*"`  
`export BACKEND_URL="*"`

- I tried the command again, and this time i got data in json format

- I got a 200 status response code on my terminal, which indicates the request has suceeded

- I stopped the server with `ctrl + c`  
- I unset the frontend and backend variables by running the commands below 
`unset FRONTEND_URL`
`unset BACKEND_URL`  
- I confirmed the unsetting by running `env | grep FRONTEND` and `env | grep BACKEND` 

### Add a Dockerfile
- I created a Dockerfile file in the **backend-flask** directory. 
- I inputed the neccesary commands needed to run my Dockerfile.

- I added comments to my Dockerfile to better understand how what is going on, things being copied, and things being installed on the host OS, and things being installed in the container.  

### Build Container 
- I went back to my product directory by running `cd ..` 
- I built my docker container by running the following command 
`docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask`

- I ran `docker images` to see my docker images
